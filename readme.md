# Computer Vision Project: Quality Control using YOLOv8 and EfficientNet with FastAPI

![Example ](example_output.jpg)

This project is a computer vision solution that uses the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and the EfficientNet classification algorithm to perform automated quality control on images. The goal of the project is to detect defects or anomalies in images of products on a production line, allowing for quick and accurate identification of quality issues. In this version of the project, we will use FastAPI to create a web application that allows users to upload images for analysis and also stream images from their webcam for real-time analysis.

## Object Detection with YOLOv8

The first step of the quality control process is object detection using the YOLOv8 algorithm. This algorithm is a real-time object detection system that uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects in an image. In the context of the quality control project, YOLOv8 is used to detect and localize any defects or anomalies in the images.

## Classification with EfficientNet

After detecting any defects or anomalies in the image, the next step is classification using the EfficientNet algorithm. This algorithm is a neural network architecture that has achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of computer vision tasks. In the context of the quality control project, EfficientNet is used to classify the entire image as either "good" or "bad" based on the presence or absence of defects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lekhanhlinhstar/Lime_quatily_control_system.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, you will need to install the required dependencies. You can do this using `pip`:

```
$
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the quality control system, you can start the web application using the following command:

```
$ uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the FastAPI application and you can navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the web interface.

The web interface allows you to upload an image for analysis by clicking on the "Choose File" button and selecting an image file from your local machine. You can also start streaming images from your webcam for real-time analysis by clicking on the "Start Webcam" button.
